# Parsing-ECE270-
We want to store information in a music library (in a library of CDs) in a CSV format according to the following structure:  &lt;Artist>,&lt;Title>,&lt;Year>,&lt;Genre>,&lt;Rating>,&lt;Fan> We will have to write the functions that will allow us to parse this information and perform a query within it.
