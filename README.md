# Parsing-ECE270-
We want to store information in a music library (in a library of CDs) in a CSV format according to the following structure: <br> &lt;Artist>,&lt;Title>,&lt;Year>,&lt;Genre>,&lt;Rating>,&lt;Fan> <br>
We will have to write the functions that will allow us to parse this information and perform a query within it.

Files avaialable PDF file, text file where data is located, main C file, and output images
